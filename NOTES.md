NOTES

DREAMFIELDS
If you come, they will build it.

PAGES 

## HOME / FEED
  -updates from projects and people you follow.
  -It's the jump off before digging into the rest of the app to do work.
  -kill some time and see what others are doing. 
  -the water cooler

## PROJECTS
  -this is an overview of the projects you are working on
  -clicking on a project brings its slug page overview still in the projects page on the layout
  -

## EDIT 
  -this is where you work
  -for project builders it's where they layout their project
  -for artists this is where they access and work with all of the assets and upload their work
  -for producers this is where they manage their projects talent

## REVIEW
  -this is a page where people review projects work
  -directors can look at the work submitted and accept and reject work
  -artists can view others work and comment on it and give suggestions
  -writers, producers, directors can submit their project here to teams to review to see if they feel like it's worthy of work or needs to be built up more.

## CHATROOMS 
  -networking
  -brainstorming
  -whiteboarding
  -collaborating 
  -maybe avoid this lol because no one would work

Ideas:
mabye make it so chat and notifications are turned off in edit mode. Keep work a succleded things.

Maybe dont put in too many social aspects. Or at least really make an effort to limit and curb them and encourage positive interactions through the system.
  

## BASIC NEEDS:

# DIRECTORS
  A project create page
  A project overview page after it's created with details for others to see
  A timeline of some kind of the project for the director to work with
  Ability to accept or reject someone's submission of work

# ARTISTS
  Ability to pull and upload work from project

# SEARCH BAR
  search by project name or user
